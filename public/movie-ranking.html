<h1>Rowan's Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>The best 3 movies I've ever seen</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>LOTR Trilogy</h3>
<p>This might be considered cheating because it's a trilogy and not just one movie. However, since childhood I've watched this trilogy annually and I never get bored of it so for that reason, I have to include it on my list of best movies ever.</p>
<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, what's not to love? I maintain that this is one of the best war movies ever made as it truly shows the horrors of WWII. The opening scene alone shows the devastation of the D-Day landings.</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is still ranked as the best movie ever by IMDB and I agree that it's fantastic. It's a movie that has a truly original story and keeps you engrossed from start to finish.</p>
